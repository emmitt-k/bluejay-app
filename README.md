### Summary Charts
- Utilizing the power of Chart.js, the system features a Summary Charts page, offering in-depth visual statistics on the quantity of damaged product parts submitted. Various chart types, including bar charts, pie charts, and line charts, display data on a weekly and monthly basis, ensuring comprehensive insights into the data.
